## Introduction

Brain lesions are a type of damage to the brain that may be caused, among other things, by three main conditions:

1. Stroke - A vascular injury or cut of blood supply to the brain. It's perhaps the main cause of brain injuries.
2. Multiple Sclerosis - A condition where lesions appear in multiple areas of the brain.
3. Lupus - An autoimmune disease with multiple manifestations and that can cause brain lesions.
